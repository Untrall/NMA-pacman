learning rules


P10
X axis is episode, Y axis is total step of pacman mouse moves within achieving certain score. 
The vary end of the episodes are the test episodes, which reverses the pacman mouse has learned how to survive longer.

P11
The food is regenerating with different probability as a Gaussian distribution. The center of distribution is at the center of the map. 
The probability for left to right is 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, as the  probability increases, the score achieved by pacman mouse within certain step will be higher


next slide
P12 
The food is regenerating as a two picks gaussian distribution. One of  the center is  at one fourth left sides. Another center is at right one fourth sides. 
The reward of food in left side is 1, but in right side is 10. 
After 300times of training, the pacman mouse has learned to get food from the right sids. 

i will now hand over to lihui
